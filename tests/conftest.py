    """Return an assertion that a per-instance transform is vectorized faithfully.

    The returned helper applies *transform* to a batch (per-instance) and then,
    for every element, re-applies the same per-element parameters to that
    element alone. The two must match, which proves the vectorized whole-batch
    computation is equivalent to processing each element independently (no
    cross-element contamination or broadcasting mistakes).

    This is only valid for transforms whose `apply_transform` is deterministic
    given the recorded parameters (the randomness lives in `make_params`).
    Transforms that sample inside `apply_transform` (e.g. Noise, LabelsToImage)
    need a different check.
